                <h5> What is 750W? </h5>
                <p>     750W is South Brunswick High School's senior robotics team. Its our job to bring home the trophy<br>
                    for both our school and ourselves. We design, test, calculate, rework, program, and drive<br>
                    the robots we build. We build these robots using a toolkit and cortex called VEX PRO. These Robots<br>
                    have been specially built and coded to perform the function required for the year's challenge.</p>

                <h5> The Challenge </h5>
                <p>     This year's challenge as presented by VEX Robotics, is the "Nothing but Net" Challenge. <br>
                    The alliances are presented with two nets, one for each alliance, and are given the task of <br>
                    using their robot to either push heavy and light balls under or over a bar, or to be able to <br>
                    load, aim, and fire the balls accurately into a net at the top of a tower. Once presented <br>
                    with the challenge initially our team got to designing and calculating many things. </p>

                <h5> W's History </h5>
                <p>     750W was created in the year 2012 to supplement the creation of the Robotics Club at <br>
                    SBHS. The team was assigned a few experienced members, and many "littles". The Seniors today<br>
                    were those littles. To this date, 750W has always qualified to the States round of the tourney<br>
                    and we hope to continue that tradition. This year, the team was assigned 5 Littles, who will <br>
                    be next year's officers, the seniors have started teaching them and they are well on their way.</p>
